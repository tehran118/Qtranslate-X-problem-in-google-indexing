# Qtranslate-X-problem-in-google-indexing
I use qtranslate, I have 3 separated sitemaps for any languages. My default language is En but any posts in other languages indexed by Google are with 2 or 3 languages URLs. For Example an Arabic title with English /en/ url. I want them just in the language which is avalaible the content. What can I to do?
